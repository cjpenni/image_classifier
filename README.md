# SEM Image Classifier with VGG16
## Project Description

This project implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) for classifying images using TensorFlow. The model utilizes the VGG16 architecture to distinguish between Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) images and non-SEM images. This work is part of an ongoing research project conducted at the Big Data Analytics Lab at Clemson University.
